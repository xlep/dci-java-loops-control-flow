# The break and continue statements

## continue
* Count down from 10 (include 0), but do not print any even number.
* Print each letter of the String "I'll make him an offer he can't refuse", but skip all spaces.

## break
* Find the first prime number above 50
  * Note: a prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 (with an even result). e.g. 1,2,3 but not 4 since 4 / 2 is

    The modulo operator ( % ) will return the "remainder" of a division (https://www.baeldung.com/modulo-java)
* Print only the first sentence of a given string (assuming we only use "." to end a sentence).
